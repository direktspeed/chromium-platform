# chromium-platform
Build cross-platform desktop apps with chromium-platform for your WASM, ECMAScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

## Why?
There is NW.js a promissing project for node + chromium i was implamenting the same for deno + chromium 
Out of my view the rust + v8 implamentation will outpferform nodejs and allows more easy creation of 
optimized nativ code.

so i plan to join the NW.js and deno-chromium projects into chromium-platform in general deno and node will both run 
anywhere chrome would run. So it is logical to join both efforts.
